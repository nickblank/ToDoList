# ToDoList

This script is a Todo List Manager that allows users to manage tasks through a simple command-line interface and stores tasks in an SQLite database for persistence. Users can add new tasks, list all tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks. It is useful because it provides a quick and efficient way to keep track of tasks without relying on external applications. The script is easy to use, requires minimal dependencies, and ensures that tasks are saved even after the script is closed, making it a reliable tool for task management.
